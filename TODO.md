# TODO:

1. **Make pull request to the forked project witch is also a forked project**

   - Only if the project is still maintained...
   - Will need to fork it again with my main GitHub account

2. **Convert to Typescript? It's probably possible**
3. ~~**Migrate the manifest to v3**~~
4. **Add the option to choose the quality of the videos (720p, 1080p, etc.)**
